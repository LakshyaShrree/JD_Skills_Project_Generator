            "**1. Simple Book Inventory Service:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Concept:**  A single microservice managing a simple book inventory.  Users can add books (title, author, ISBN, quantity), view the inventory, and update quantities.\n",
            "* **Java Technology:** Spring Boot (for ease of development).  Consider using JPA/Hibernate for database interaction.\n",
            "* **AWS Services:**\n",
            "    * **Amazon EC2:** A single EC2 instance to host the application.  Start with a free tier eligible instance.  You can explore different instance types later.\n",
            "    * **Amazon RDS (MySQL or PostgreSQL):**  A managed relational database to store book information. Again, utilize the free tier if possible.\n",
            "    * **AWS CLI:** To interact with AWS services from your local machine for deployment.\n",
            "* **Microservices Aspect:** While only one service, this introduces the fundamental concept of a self-contained unit of functionality.  This serves as a stepping stone before building more complex distributed systems.\n",
            "* **Beginner Friendly aspects:**  Relatively small codebase, focuses on basic CRUD operations, uses readily available AWS services, and easy to deploy and manage a single instance.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Two-Service E-commerce (Product Catalog and Order Service):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Concept:** Two microservices: one for managing a product catalog (similar to the Book Inventory but more features like adding descriptions, images, pricing) and another for handling orders (placing orders, managing order status, etc.).  These services communicate with each other (e.g., order service needs to check product availability in the catalog service).\n",
            "* **Java Technology:** Spring Boot. Consider using a message broker like Amazon SQS or a lightweight message queue like RabbitMQ (which can be run on an EC2 instance) for asynchronous communication between services.\n",
            "* **AWS Services:**\n",
            "    * **Amazon EC2 (or ECS/EKS):**  Two EC2 instances (one for each service), or explore containerization with ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for a more advanced approach (although slightly more complex for beginners).\n",
            "    * **Amazon RDS:** A managed database for each service (or a single database if you prefer, but separating databases is best practice for microservices).\n",
            "    * **Amazon SQS (or RabbitMQ on EC2):** For asynchronous communication.\n",
            "* **Microservices Aspect:** This project introduces inter-service communication, a crucial aspect of microservices architecture.\n",
            "* **Beginner Friendly aspects:** Building on the previous project, you incrementally add complexity by adding a second service and inter-service communication.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**3.  Simple Blog with User Authentication and Commenting (Three Services):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Concept:** Three microservices: one for managing blog posts, one for user accounts (including authentication/authorization using something like Spring Security), and one for handling comments on posts.\n",
            "* **Java Technology:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, potentially JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.\n",
            "* **AWS Services:**\n",
            "    * **Amazon EC2 (or ECS/EKS):** Three EC2 instances (or containers), one for each service.\n",
            "    * **Amazon RDS:**  Possibly multiple databases, one for each service, or a shared database (but separate schemas are recommended for microservice best practices).\n",
            "    * **Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):** For asynchronous communication (e.g., notifying users of new comments).\n",
            "    * **AWS Cognito (Optional but recommended):** A managed user directory and authentication service, simplifying user management.\n",
            "* **Microservices Aspect:** This project demonstrates more complex interactions between multiple services, including authentication and authorization, and asynchronous communication patterns.\n",
            "* **Beginner Friendly aspects (relative):** This is the most complex project, but building on the previous two, the concepts should be more manageable.  Focus on one service at a time and gradually integrate them.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:** Remember to start small.  Focus on understanding the fundamental concepts of each technology before moving on to more advanced features.  The AWS free tier is a great resource for learning and experimenting.  Start with the first project and work your way up to the others as you gain confidence and experience.  Don't be afraid to search for tutorials and documentation online â€“ it's a valuable part of the learning process.\n",

This project focuses on leveraging user listening history to predict future preferences.  Go beyond simple collaborative filtering; explore techniques like content-based filtering (analyzing audio features) and hybrid approaches.  Deploy your model using a simple Flask or Streamlit app for a user-friendly interface.  The challenge lies in creatively handling the sparsity of data inherent in music listening habits and effectively incorporating diverse audio features into your model.\n\n**Skills Used:** Python (with libraries like Spotipy, Librosa), PyTorch or TensorFlow, Feature Engineering (audio feature extraction), SQL (for potentially storing and querying user data if you choose to cache it locally), Model Deployment (Flask/Streamlit).\n\n**Learning Resources:**\n* **Spotipy API Documentation:**  Learn how to interact with the Spotify API.\n* **Librosa Tutorials (YouTube):**  Understand audio feature extraction using Librosa.\n* **Flask or Streamlit Tutorials (various online sources):** Learn to deploy your model as a web application.\n\n\n**Project 2:  Fake News Detection using BigQuery & BERT (5-7 weeks)**\n\n**Concept:** This project tackles the issue of misinformation by building a fake news detection system. You'll leverage BigQuery's scalability to process a large dataset of news articles (potentially scraped from the web â€“ handle ethical considerations carefully). The unique twist is using a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning it on your data.  Focus your feature engineering on identifying stylistic characteristics and sources that are often correlated with fake news. Deploy your model as a REST API using a framework like FastAPI.\n\n**Skills Used:** Python (with Transformers library), TensorFlow/PyTorch (using BERT), SQL (for data extraction and manipulation in BigQuery), Feature Engineering (textual analysis), Model Deployment (FastAPI).\n\n**Learning Resources:**\n* **Hugging Face Transformers Documentation:** Learn about using pre-trained BERT models.\n* **Google Cloud BigQuery Tutorials (Google Cloud Skills Boost):** Understand BigQuery's data manipulation capabilities.\n* **FastAPI Tutorial (various online sources):** Learn how to build REST APIs using FastAPI.\n\n\n**Project 3:  Personalized Product Recommendation System with Image-Based Features (7-9 weeks)**\n\n**Concept:**  This project differs by incorporating image data into a recommendation system.  Scrape product images and descriptions from an e-commerce site (respecting their robots.txt and terms of service). Use image feature extraction techniques (e.g., using pre-trained convolutional neural networks like ResNet) along with text features from product descriptions.  Combine these features to build a recommendation model, paying close attention to handling the diverse data types effectively.  Deploy this model to provide personalized recommendations based on user browsing history.\n\n**Skills Used:** Python (with libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for image feature extraction and model building), SQL (optional, for managing user data), Feature Engineering (combining image and text features), Model Deployment (Flask/Streamlit or similar).\n\n**Learning Resources:**\n* **OpenCV Tutorials (YouTube):** Learn about image processing techniques in OpenCV.\n* **TensorFlow/PyTorch Tutorials (official websites):** Learn how to use pre-trained CNNs and build your recommendation model.\n* **Deploying ML Models with Flask/Streamlit Tutorials (various online sources):**  Learn about deploying the model.\n\n\nThese projects encourage creativity and problem-solving beyond simple tutorial replication, aligning with the required skills and providing a strong portfolio for a job application at Meta or similar companies. Remember to emphasize ethical considerations (data privacy, responsible scraping, avoiding bias in datasets) in your project documentation.\n"
