Uses an in-memory data store (like an ArrayList initially, then upgrade to an in-memory DB like H2 for persistence) for simplicity.  Exposes a REST API (using Spring Boot) for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n",
            "    * **Recommendation Service:**  (Optional, but good for learning)  A very basic service that suggests books based on a simple algorithm (e.g., randomly selecting books from the inventory).  Also exposes a REST API.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **AWS:**\n",
            "    * **Amazon EC2:** Deploy each microservice to a separate EC2 instance (t2.micro is sufficient for learning). This provides a basic understanding of deployment.  Alternatively, use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easier deployment.\n",
            "    * **Simple Load Balancer (Optional):** If you add the recommendation service and want to load balance requests across both, you can introduce a simple load balancer in front of your instances.\n",

Alternatively, you could manage users in your own database, but Cognito is much easier to get started with.\n",
